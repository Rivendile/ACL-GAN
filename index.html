  Abstract
  </div>
  <p class = "abstractText">
  Unpaired image-to-image translation is a class of vision problems whose goal is to find the mapping between different image domains using unpaired training data. Cycle-consistency loss is a widely used constraint for such problems. However, due to the strict pixel-level constraint, it cannot perform shape changes, remove large objects, or ignore irrelevant texture. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial-consistency loss for image-to-image translation. This loss does not require the translated image to be translated back to be a specific source image but can encourage the translated images to retain important features of the source images and overcome the drawbacks of cycle-consistency loss noted above. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on three challenging tasks: glasses removal, male-to-female translation, and selfie-to-anime translation.

              Our method does not require cycle consistency, so it can bypass unnecessary features. Moreover, with the proposed adversarial-consistency loss, our method can explicitly encourage the generator to maintain the commonalities between the source and target domains.
